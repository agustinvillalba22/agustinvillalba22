 ## About me  ðŸ‘¤
I'm a junior UX-UI designer passionate about creating digital experiences that connect with people. With a strong
background in graphic design and a meticulous focus on details, I'm currently developing skills in HTML and CSS,
which complement my ability to translate creative ideas into functional and attractive interfaces. I am actively seeking
opportunities to add value in a dynamic environment where I can continue to grow professionally and contribute to the
creation of innovative products. Additionally, my experience in digital art and my ability to adapt to new challenges
allow me to approach problems from a fresh, multidisciplinary perspective.
